This package is just a placeholder that requires 
* oracle-instantclient-basic
* oracle-instantclient-devel
* oracle-instantclient-sqlplus

It also provides libclntsh.so.10 because the oracle rpm 
does not for some reason.  Any packages that build against
Oracle for connectors (php-pecl-oci8, perl-DBD-Oracle, etc) 
normally require this lib.  This package will provide.
